## Introduction to MediaPipe4U  

**MediaPipe4U** is an Unreal Engine plugin that integrates various complex technologies into Unreal Engine, providing a one-stop solution for digital human development.  

???+ tip "What You Need to Know"  
    Although you can obtain a free license file, **MediaPipe4U** is not free software.  

    - I make no commitments to users utilizing free license files. This includes providing free license files, which may change in the future.  
      The **MediaPipe4U** plugin includes a license file with a validity period. Typically, this license file will expire within 30 to 60 days (starting from the release date of a new version).  

    - In other words, the license file must be updated periodically.  
      For detailed information regarding licensing, please refer to [this section](./licensing/index.md).
