## Introduction to MediaPipe4U  

MediaPipe4U is an Unreal Engine plugin that integrates multiple advanced technologies into Unreal Engine,  
offering a one-stop solution for digital human development.  

???+ tip "What You Need to Know"  
    While you can obtain a free license file, MediaPipe4U is not free software.    

    - I make no commitments to users who use the free license file. This includes providing free license files,  
      and this policy may change in the future.    
      The MediaPipe4U plugin includes a license file with an expiration date. Typically, this license file  
      expires 30 to 60 days after the release of a new version.  

    - In other words, you must update the license file periodically.    
      For more details about licensing, please refer to [this section](./licensing/index.md).
