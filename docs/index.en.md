???+ tip "What You Need to Know"
    Although you can obtain a license file for free, **MediaPipe4U** is not free software.  
    - I do not make any commitments to users who utilize free license files. This includes the provision of free license files, which may also change in the future.  
    The **MediaPipe4U** plugin includes a license file with an expiration date. Typically, this license file will expire after 30 to 60 days (starting from the release date of the new version).  
    - In other words, the license file must be updated periodically.  
    For detailed information about licensing, please refer to [here](./licensing).
