# Software License

## About This Software

**MediaPipe4U** is not open-source software and is licensed through a proprietary license. Currently, the same license can be used across multiple computers.  

The plugin contains a license file located in the directory:  
`Plugins/MediaPipe4U/Source/MediaPipe/license`  
If you obtain a new license, replace the existing file in this directory to update the license validity period.  

If the license expires (e.g., due to expiration), the plugin's core functionalities (such as motion capture and facial expression capture) will become unavailable. However, this will not cause the program to crash.  

!!! note "Summary of MediaPipe4U Licensing"  
    In short, both the free and paid versions of MediaPipe4U can be used for any purpose, including commercial use. For a detailed explanation, please refer to the software license agreement below.
