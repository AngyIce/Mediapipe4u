# Paid Version

You can use **MediaPipe4U** for any commercial project, even if you are using the free version (Trial License), without worrying about licensing issues.  
However, if you find this plugin useful and your project cannot accept frequent (30-day) license updates, you may consider purchasing the paid version.

## Payment Methods

Currently, **MediaPipe4U** offers two licensing models::

1. **Annual Subscription**: Billed annually, per project[^1].
2. **Device License**: Billed per device, tied to a specific device, with no time limit and no restrictions on the number of projects.

[^1]: A "project" refers to a single Unreal Engine project, i.e., a single `xxxx.uproject` file.

Note that the device license is non-transferable. This model relies on hardware characteristics for license validation. If hardware is changed (e.g., replacing a hard drive), the license may become invalid and will require repurchase. In short, any change in hardware characteristics will require a new payment.


!!! tip "Special Notes"

    Pricing is **not** based on the number of users in your project. Whether your project has 1 user or 1 million users, the cost remains the same.    
    The annual license is tied to your **Unreal Project Name**.  

    How do we determine the number of projects using the plugin? It is based on trust!   
    **If we discover multiple projects using a single license, technical support and renewal requests will be denied.**

## Pricing

As development continues, pricing may change as more features are added. Existing paid users will be notified in advance of any price adjustments.  
If you are not comfortable with a new price, you can continue using the version you purchased at the original price, with long-term bug fix support.
